                        <p>As a Data Scientist at Alcon, I play a crucial role in the development and implementation of software and algorithms for a large-scale project involving over 40 team members. My key responsibilities include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Data Management:</strong> Scraping, cleaning, and structuring data, followed by integration into a cloud database (AWS). I create and maintain accessible tables to ensure seamless data availability for the entire team.</li>
                            <li><strong>Analytical Insights:</strong> Conducting comprehensive sales and product functionality analyses, along with creating visualizations to monitor and report on key performance indicators (KPIs).</li>
                            <li><strong>Product Development:</strong> Leading the development of our primary product, a sophisticated recommendation algorithm, and building various machine learning models to support the overall project.</li>
                            <li><strong>Application Maintenance:</strong> Ensuring the smooth operation of the application in the production environment, including bug fixing and batch management.</li>
                            <li><strong>Scrum Participation:</strong> Actively engaging in Scrum ceremonies, presenting results, and collaborating with stakeholders to drive project success.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mentorship and Support:</strong> Providing guidance and support to less experienced team members, fostering a collaborative and growth-oriented environment.</li>

                    <div class="company-description">
                        <p>At mBank, I had the chance to encounter big data for the first time, as I was part of the team that was in charge of the data warehouse. As a team, we checked the quality of the data, created the views needed for business applications, and controlled the data flow.</p>
                        
                        <p>At the time, I was keen to develop in the direction of classical data science, so I repeatedly took the initiative to develop ML models to help us with data control and credit forecasting. I then found a slightly more experienced person in the team to start working with. Due to my then only training experience, I started working with the Data Science department, which led us to develop two models that were released for use.</p>
                        
                        <p>These models are probably still in use today and help predict monthly credit scores. mBank was a valuable experience because there I learned how to build relationships with people so as to lead them towards a common goal, which in this case was to do something new for the department.</p>

                        <p>At Leanpassion, in my role as a business consultant, I learned an extraordinary amount about organisation and saving resources. Leanpassion, as the name suggests, deals with business transformations based on Lean Management.</p>
                        
                        <p>In a nutshell, the transformations I have dealt with can be broken down into a few steps:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Goal setting during discussions with project sponsors from the client side.</li>
                            <li>Long-term observation and identification of problems in the designated workplace or business process.</li>
                            <li>Prioritisation of proposed changes during discussions with sponsors and process participants.</li>
                            <li>Leading during the first moments of change</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p>In addition to this, part of my work has also been to provide training for Lean Green Belt certification. In order to be able to conduct these, I first had to become certified myself.</p>
                        
                        <p>I have acted for large clients such as IKEA of Sweden, OBI, OBI IT, BNP Paribas, and Auchan. I definitely mastered customer relationship building and project management during this time.</p>
