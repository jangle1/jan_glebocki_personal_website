                        <p>As a Data Scientist at Alcon, I play a crucial role in the development and implementation of software and algorithms for a large-scale project involving over 40 team members. My key responsibilities include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Data Management:</strong> Scraping, cleaning, and structuring data, followed by integration into a cloud database (AWS). I create and maintain accessible tables to ensure seamless data availability for the entire team.</li>
                            <li><strong>Analytical Insights:</strong> Conducting comprehensive sales and product functionality analyses, along with creating visualizations to monitor and report on key performance indicators (KPIs).</li>
                            <li><strong>Product Development:</strong> Leading the development of our primary product, a sophisticated recommendation algorithm, and building various machine learning models to support the overall project.</li>
                            <li><strong>Application Maintenance:</strong> Ensuring the smooth operation of the application in the production environment, including bug fixing and batch management.</li>
                            <li><strong>Scrum Participation:</strong> Actively engaging in Scrum ceremonies, presenting results, and collaborating with stakeholders to drive project success.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mentorship and Support:</strong> Providing guidance and support to less experienced team members, fostering a collaborative and growth-oriented environment.</li>

                    <div class="company-description">
                        <p>At mBank, I had the chance to encounter big data for the first time, as I was part of the team that was in charge of the data warehouse. As a team, we checked the quality of the data, created the views needed for business applications, and controlled the data flow.</p>
                        
                        <p>At the time, I was keen to develop in the direction of classical data science, so I repeatedly took the initiative to develop ML models to help us with data control and credit forecasting. I then found a slightly more experienced person in the team to start working with. Due to my then only training experience, I started working with the Data Science department, which led us to develop two models that were released for use.</p>
                        
                        <p>These models are probably still in use today and help predict monthly credit scores. mBank was a valuable experience because there I learned how to build relationships with people so as to lead them towards a common goal, which in this case was to do something new for the department.</p>

                        <p>At Leanpassion, in my role as a business consultant, I learned an extraordinary amount about organisation and saving resources. Leanpassion, as the name suggests, deals with business transformations based on Lean Management.</p>
                        
                        <p>In a nutshell, the transformations I have dealt with can be broken down into a few steps:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Goal setting during discussions with project sponsors from the client side.</li>
                            <li>Long-term observation and identification of problems in the designated workplace or business process.</li>
                            <li>Prioritisation of proposed changes during discussions with sponsors and process participants.</li>
                            <li>Leading during the first moments of change</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>In addition to this, part of my work has also been to provide training for Lean Green Belt certification. In order to be able to conduct these, I first had to become certified myself.</p>
                        
                        <p>I have acted for large clients such as IKEA of Sweden, OBI, OBI IT, BNP Paribas, and Auchan. I definitely mastered customer relationship building and project management during this time.</p>

The conference was watched live by around 300 people and another 300 people online. I consider this event an achievement, because the speakers at this conference were really recognisable people such as Marcin Prokop, Vital Heynen or Maciej Noga, and on top of that, in my opinion, I presented myself really well.</p>
