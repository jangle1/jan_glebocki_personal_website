                    <p>Hello, and welcome to my personal page!</p>
                    <p>I'm from the city of Warsaw, where I’ve spent most of my life. My journey has been shaped by the people I've chosen to surround myself with, and I believe that my friendships have played a significant role in who I am today.</p>
                    <p>My love for music began early. For nine years, I dedicated myself to mastering the guitar (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUPyqEIyINk" target="_blank">here is a link to one of my performances</a>). Starting from primary school, I progressed through music school, reaching the second level before deciding to shift my focus to sports. This transition marked the beginning of a new chapter in my life.</p>
                    <p>During my high school years and the start of my university studies, I pursued athletics professionally. Specializing in the 200m and 400m sprints, I trained rigorously every day at a professional club in Warsaw. This dedication led to multiple finals at Polish championships and even some medals – achievements that mean a lot to me.</p>

                    <p>Academically, I chose to study at the Warsaw School of Economics, where I initially majored in business. My involvement in the student government, particularly in organizing the SGH run, was a rewarding experience. I successfully defended my bachelor's thesis in 2023. Currently, I’m still at SGH, delving into Big Data to solidify my technical skills.</p>
                    <p>Sport remains a significant part of my life. As an ex-athlete, I have an enduring need to train. Currently, I’m preparing for a 1/4 Ironman triathlon, though I often dabble in various other disciplines. My days are filled with more than just work; I immerse myself in personal projects and continually enrich my portfolio.</p>
                    <p>I have a keen interest in the startup ecosystem, attending events, meetings, and lectures to connect with like-minded individuals. My curiosity often leads me to work on ideas that could potentially evolve into startups.</p>
                    <p>Outside of my professional and academic pursuits, I cherish spending time with my family and friends, traveling, and diving into good books.</p>
                    <p>Thanks for taking the time to learn a little bit about me!</p>
